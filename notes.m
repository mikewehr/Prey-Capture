% ask jen to send link/email for DLT code/lab, and training protocol
% we need to track both ears (and possibly body) - code currently requires body track, but they don't end up using it much

% Jen's protocol (she will send a written version of this)
% Day 0 = acclimatization
% Day 1 = 3 10-minute exposures to cricket in arena, staggered
% Day 2 = start data acquisition, they will take ~5 minutes to catch
% by Day 3-4 good mice should be catching in 10 seconds, some mice still take minutes
% By Day 5 all mice should be catching in 10-30 seconds
% Day 4-5 and onwards = good data collection
% crickets in home cage every night (she used 1 cricket per mouse)
food deprivation starts Day 1-2 and continues indefinitely
% food deprivation = no chow in home cage overnight, access to chow (in
% home cage) for a couple hours after capture session, then no chow
% overnight
% they haven't had to drop mice for non-performance, at least not recently
